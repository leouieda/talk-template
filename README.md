# Template for Reveal.js based talks

This is a template I use to make [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) slides.
The slide contents are in `slides.md`, which is loaded into `index.html`.
There is also custom styling and CSS classes to place items on slides defined
in `css/style.less` (using [Less](http://lesscss.org/)).

Most of the components used are included in the repository so that the
presentation can work offline in a pinch.

The original inspiration is this template by Matthew Turk:
https://github.com/matthewturk/mjt-talk-template

## Serving the slides

## Locally

Install [livereload](https://github.com/lepture/python-livereload):

```
pip install livereload
```

or

```
conda install livereload -c conda-forge
```

Use `make serve` to start a server at http://localhost:8008. The page will
automatically reload the page when you update any of the files in the
repository.

## GitHub Pages

Go to your repository `Setting > Pages` and select `Source` as your
`main` branch and folder `/ (root)`. You probably want to select
`Enforce HTTPS` as well.

Your talk should now be served at https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY
(it may take a little while for this to happen).
For example, this template is served at
https://www.leouieda.com/talk-template/ (I use a custom domain).
